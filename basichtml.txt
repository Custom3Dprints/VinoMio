i want to keep it a dropdown for times but i only want these times available if that time hasn't passed. how?

//prompt for email
how would i go about using amazon ses. be doing the steps needed, are there any criteria i need to meet? my only goal for now is to be able to send emails with the information collected from user. I am only sending emials to 2 email address each time the submit button is clicked. I also want there to be a cancel reservation button in each email at the bottom so that when clicked it will auto cancel the reservation and send another email to person 2 saying  the details of the canceled reservation

//prompt for google calender:
i have a collection in firestone database: name, emial, phone number, number of guests, time, date.
